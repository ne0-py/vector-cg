### I am trying to create a template of an app that could show easily show how to use Firebase in Flutter

I will be adding more comments throughout the project and improve categorzation of different screeens into folders.

The app uses basic email and password authentication, it does not verify the email account.

*the login screen certainly requires a logo or a background image*

This is still work in progress, so far the user can create a new document within a single collection.
But I want to add more screens to update and delete these.
